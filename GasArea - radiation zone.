// modified script that adds a radiation zone and does damage if the player isn't wearing proper attire while also limiting vision, and adding a camera shake as well as a nasty cough.
//original creator is j-wolf.
//effects were added to make it more realistic. camshake/dynamic blur/ sound / although sound is modded with cfgsounds.
