Arma Scripts


 most of the code was a quick fix solution for what I needed done at the time.You will most likely need to make minor changes to each segment to get what you want.
 Mostly just removing the playSounds as those were made with mods. Also, most of the objects were assigned ingame with the eden editor init.
